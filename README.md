I am going to introduce our methodology.
We developed two questionnaires for the survey.
One is demographic information, including gender, age and net age.
The other is measurement of model scale, including use of information system, sports activities and health conditions.
The questionnaires given to undergraduates consisted of 16 questions grouped in six sections.
Copies of the questionnaires were sent to students attending street interviews.
Before issuing the questionnaires formally, we carried out a predictive test. According to the feedback results, we revised measurement items of the questionnaires.
We used SPSS to analyze the data. The variables studied in this paper have good convergence validity and discrimination validity.
